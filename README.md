ardunav
=======

Open Source AHRS development platform and Algorithms

An extremely low-cost, simple and yet accurate tool to create your own AHRS and run your sensor-fusion algorithms in Arduino using the following sensors - MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscopes), HMC 5883L (magnetometer) and NEO-6M GPS module. The ardunav also includes a HC-05 to transmit data over Bluetooth to a nearby ground station. 

A complete working video of the ardunav will be uploaded shortly.

Open Source AHRS Development platform for testing Algorithms

An extremely low-cost, simple and yet accurate tool to create your own AHRS and run your sensor-fusion algorithms in Arduino Due using the following sensors - MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscopes), HMC 5883L (magnetometer) and NEO-6M GPS module. The ardunav also includes a HC-05 to transmit data over Bluetooth to a nearby ground station. 

The Firmware utilizes Eigen 3 for Matrix Computations and Kalman Filtering.

A complete working video of the ardunav will be uploaded shortly.

I would like to thank Prof. Demoz-Gebre Egziabher, Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Minnesota and Mr. Brian Taylor, Director, UAV Lab, University of Minnesota for taking the course AEM 5333, Design to Flight:UAV and helping me build an open source AHRS.
